Traffic-Sign-Detector ðŸš¦
=========================

Enhance road safety with Traffic-Sign-Detector, a cutting-edge project that classifies traffic signs using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ResNet models, this project is trained on the extensive German Traffic Sign Benchmark dataset, which includes over 50,000 images across 40+ traffic sign categories.

ðŸš€ Highlights:
==============
High Accuracy: Achieved 97% accuracy with a fine-tuned CNN model and an impressive 99.26% with a fine-tuned ResNet50 model.

Robust Performance: Overcome real-world variations in traffic sign images with deep learning models that learn and extract features automatically.

State-of-the-Art Methodology: Utilized image preprocessing, batch normalization, and dropout techniques to optimize model performance.

ðŸ›  Methodology:
================
Data: Preprocessed and resized images from the German Traffic Sign Benchmark dataset.

Training: Conducted on Google Colab GPU with a 75:25 testing-to-validation split, 20 epochs, batch size of 32, and learning rate of 0.001.

ðŸŒŸ Impact:
======================
This project not only demonstrates the power of CNN and ResNet in traffic sign classification but also aims to contribute to road safety improvements by minimizing human errors in traffic sign recognition.


Explore how deep learning can drive safety on our roads and potentially save lives through better traffic sign detection.
